                <h3>Murderer Shot in Neck by friend, Authorities Say</h3>
                <p>Soledad, the 18th of August 1936.   On a small ranch just outside the small town, a tragic murder occurred.   According to the police and the description, the murderer was identified as Lennie Small, also accused of rape earlier this year in Weed, California (see right, and continuation on page 12).   The woman, whose examination revealed a snapped neck, was identified as the wife of the ranch boss&#39; son, Carl West, who goes by Curley.   “I&#39;m real sad &#39;bout the death o&#39; my wife.  Hell, I woulda shot the murderin&#39; son-of-a-bitch myself if I had to,” said Mr. West when we asked his thoughts on the accused.   The murderer was shot in the neck by a Luger pistol shortly after the murder, by his companion George Milton.   The accused was shot by a nearby pond after fleeing the scene of the crime.  Mr. Small willingly put the weapon down and, according to Mr. Milton, stared down the pond, thinking about better times.   Mr. Milton then took the weapon and shot Mr. Small in the back of the neck, killing him instantly.   While this may sound like a crime in itself, Mr. Milton says otherwise.  We approached him to ask for comment on his actions and those of his late partner, and he had some interesting points to tell us.  “I di&#39;n&#39;t wanna shoot &#39;im.  He di&#39;n&#39;t know nuthin&#39; &#39;bout what he was doin&#39;.  He wa&#39;n&#39;t that smart, and he just see somethin&#39;, and he just wanna feel it, ya understand.” (The late Mr. Small was recently accused of rape, and has been known to kill animals placed in his posession.) “He just don&#39;t know what he doin&#39;.  He di&#39;n&#39;t know &#39;is own strength, an&#39; you gave &#39;im somethin&#39; to pet and he jes pets it too hard.  And su&#39;nly it&#39;s dead and I hadda take it away from &#39;im and he don&#39; know what he done bad.”  When asked why he chose to end his best friend&#39;s life, Mr. Milton responded, “I di&#39;n&#39;t wanna do it, honest I di&#39;n&#39;t.   But Curley was comin&#39; up fast, and he was wantin&#39; to shoot Lennie clean in the gut, and I di&#39;n&#39;t want &#39;im [Mr. Small] to die in pain.  I wanted &#39;im to be real happy.  So I talked to &#39;im an&#39; told &#39;im about all the great things we was gonna do when we gone and buyed our own place.  We was gonna live of the fatta the lan&#39;.  But I know after what he done we wasn&#39;t gonna be able ta do that.  They all on the ranch was chasin&#39; after &#39;im, and they was gonna lynch &#39;im.  We coulda&#39; run, but we di&#39;n&#39;t have none of our things, and we couldn&#39;ta run away without none of our stuff.  So I di&#39;n&#39;t have no other choice, so I just hadda shoot him while he was happy so he could have a quick an&#39; painless death.  I di&#39;n&#39;t wanna do it.  But I couldn&#39;a done nuthin else.” Mr. Small was buried in the forest in an unmarked grave.  The victim, Mrs. Josephine West, will have a memorial service held on Wednesday in the Soledad Funeral Parlor.  May she rest in peace.</p>

                <h3>RAPE</h3>
                <h3>IN WEED?</h3>
                <p>This week in Weed, California, Ms. Annabel Nolene was a victim of rape.  The accused attacker was unidentified, but was thought to be an idiot recently employed at a local ranch.  He apparently wouldn’t let go of the victim’s dress and started to shake her violently.  The idiot and his accomplice could not be found despite a search, which was abandoned in the evening after it was assumed that the accused and his friend had escaped.  Ms. Norlene described the offender as a tall, firm man who seemed to not comprehend what she was saying.  Ms. Norlene told the authorities that she will give the man who finds that man a reward of serious value.  <em>Continued on pg. 12</em></p>

                <p>The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has once again demonstrated to raise awareness of animal cruelty in the state of California.  The ASPCA believes that animals should be treated kindly, and fights “to provide effective means for the prevention of cruelty to animals throughout the United States.” They are attempting to fight practices such as the inhumane shooting of old or useless animals, or the drowning or otherwise killing of the weakest of a litter.  <em>More about the animal rights movement on page 3</em></p>
