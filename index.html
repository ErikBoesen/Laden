            <h2>WOMAN MURDERED ON SOLEDAD RANCH!</h2>
            <h3>Murderer Shot in Neck by friend, Authorities Say</h3>
            <p>Soledad, the 18th of August 1936.  On a small ranch just outside the small town, a tragic murder occurred.  According to the police and the description, the murderer seemed to have been the same person accused of rape earlier this year in Weed, California.  Identified as Lennie Small, he had supposedly broke the woman’s neck.  The woman was identified as the ranch boss’s son’s wife, Carl West, who goes by Curley.  “I am overwhelmed with the death of my wife, hell I woulda shot that son-of-a-bitch myself if I had to.  The murderer was shot in the neck by a Luger pistol shortly after the murder, by his companion George Milton, also originally from Weed.  It all went down at a pond, where Mr Small willingly put the weapon down and, according to Mr. Milton, stared down the pond, thinking about better times.  “In this place you can’t jus’ simply get away with these things, you gotta act fast.” Police chief of Soledad exclaimed in Mr Milton’s defense.  That was the only comment that Mr. Milton has left regarding the death of his companion. What is known is that the the victim was found dead in a barn alongside a dead puppy which was already cold.  It seemed like the murderer was a maniac who had the want for blood.</p>

                <h3>Rape in Weed?</h3>
                <p>This week in Weed, California, Ms. Annabel Nolene was a victim of rape. The accused attacker was unidentified, but was thought to be an idiot recently employed at a local ranch. He apparently wouldn’t let go of the victim’s dress and started to shake her violently.  The idiot and his accomplice could not be found despite a search, which was abandoned in the evening after it was assumed that the accused and his friend had escaped. Ms. Norlene described the offender as a tall, firm man who seemed to not comprehend what she was saying.  Ms. Norlene told the authorities that she will give the man who finds that man a reward of serious value.</p>
